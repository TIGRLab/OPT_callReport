>We are currently in month `r targets[targets$month == as.character(substr(Sys.Date(), 1, 7)), 'month_count']` of the study.  

This report is meant to provide a quick overview of the OPTIMUM-Neuro study, to facilitate discussion on its bi-weekly conference calls. All data summarized here derives from the 'tracking' arm of the WashU REDCap database (arm 6), and thus is only as accurate as the data captured there.

###Recruitment

#merge back dataframes #what's the purpose of merging it here?

###Enrollment breakdown

###Demographics 

```{r demographics, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

demo_table <- make_demo_table(df, sites)

```

```{r demographics_table, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

demo_table$p <- as.numeric(demo_table$p)

It does not take into account the participants who consented but did not meet enrollment criteria, and/or who later terminated. Values in brackets are standard deviation. The _p_ values result from Chi-squared for categorical variables and omnibus ANOVA for continuous variables.")

#note to self.... the enrollmrimth thing doesnt really work as the only indicator, it should really be combined with mr_t1 (which is enroll_mri i guess) to give an accurate picture of numbers. 


fu_due_list <- recruit_df%>% select(record_id,mri_fu_due, np_fu_due, bld_fu_due) %>% filter(!is.na(mri_fu_due) | !is.na( np_fu_due) | !is.na( bld_fu_due))

fu_df <- recruit_df %>% filter(.,timepoint=="6 mth FU") %>% select(.,-c(enroll_mri, enroll_mri_date)) 

fu_df <- prep_fu_df(fu_df) %>% merge(.,fu_due_list, by=c('record_id'))

  #Sooo I'll calculate stuff kind of this way: 
  sum(fu_df$enroll_mri[fu_df$site.x=='UP'], na.rm=TRUE)
  
```


I guess I can remove the percentages here, although I may want to do percentage of people who consented 8 or more months ago who are obtaining follow-up!! That'd be cool.

In order to do that, I'll need a df with participant IDs, initial scan date, later scan date, whether it's >= 6 months earlier. 

AFTER HERE IS THE NOT REAL STUFF THAT I SHOULD DELETE OR MOVE AROUND LATER
```{r}

fu_table <- make_fu_table(fu_df, sites,targets)

```




```{r}
df1 <- fu_df %>% select(record_id, fu_mri = enroll_mri, fu_mri_date = enroll_mri_date)


df2 <- enroll_df %>% select(record_id, enroll_mri, enroll_mri_date)

#testmerged <- merge(df2 ,df1,by=c('record_id'), all=TRUE) %>%
#  mutate(., fu_due = ifelse(enroll_mri_date %m+% months(6) < Sys.Date(), 1, 0))

#fu_due_list <- testmerged %>% select(record_id,fu_due) 

#fu_df2 <- fu_df %>% merge(.,fu_due_list, by=c('record_id'))


```



TODO: change the MRI coding (because we have options 1 2 and 3 now in the neuro mri form), and also make it not rely on mri date
