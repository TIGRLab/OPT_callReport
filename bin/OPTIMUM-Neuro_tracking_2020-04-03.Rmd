>We are currently in month `r targets[targets$month == as.character(substr(Sys.Date(), 1, 7)), 'month_count']` of the study.  

This report is meant to provide a quick overview of the OPTIMUM-Neuro study, to facilitate discussion on its bi-weekly conference calls. All data summarized here derives from the 'tracking' arm of the WashU REDCap database (arm 6), and thus is only as accurate as the data captured there. This report was generated on `r as.character(Sys.time())`

###Recruitment


```{r recruit_table, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

###Enrollment breakdown

```{r enrollment_table, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

  enroll_table <- make_enroll_table(recruit_df, sites, targets)

#add row names to make like demo table
enroll_table <- cbind(metric = rownames(enroll_table), enroll_table)
rownames(enroll_table) <- NULL

#turns NAs into dashes
options(knitr.kable.NA = '--')

#table
kable(enroll_table, "html", escape = F, align = c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_styling("hover", "condensed", full_width = T) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ", "CU" = 2, "LA" = 2, "UP" = 2, "UT" = 2, "WU" = 2, " ")) %>%
  group_rows('Neuropsych[note]', 1, 2, label_row_css = "background-color: #ddd; color: 999;") %>%
  group_rows("Blood[note]", 3, 4, label_row_css = "background-color: #ddd; color: 999;") %>%
  group_rows("MRI[note]", 5, 6, label_row_css = "background-color: #ddd; color: 999;") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "20em", background = '#f5f5f5') %>%
  add_footnote(c(
     "`Neuropsych` counts all participants who completed both the RBANS and D-KEFS in full.",
     "`Blood` counts all participants who submitted one aliquot of plasma.",
     "`MRI` counts all participants who completed the T1."),

  footnote(general = "Current month captures calendar month. The `%` columns calculate percentage of target, with all sites having common targets.")
              
```

###6 Month Follow-up 


Here, the % column indicates retention - this is calculated as the percent of participants who received an evaluation at baseline who have also received their 6 month follow-up evaluation. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

fu_table <- make_fu_table(fu_df, sites,targets)

#add row names to make like demo table
fu_table <- cbind(metric = rownames(fu_table), fu_table)
rownames(fu_table) <- NULL

#turns NAs into dashes
options(knitr.kable.NA = '--')

#table
kable(fu_table, "html", escape = F, align = c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_styling("hover", "condensed", full_width = T) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" ", "CU" = 2, "LA" = 2, "UP" = 2, "UT" = 2, "WU" = 2, " ")) %>%
  group_rows('Neuropsych[note]', 1, 2, label_row_css = "background-color: #ddd; color: 999;") %>%
  group_rows("Blood[note]", 3, 4, label_row_css = "background-color: #ddd; color: 999;") %>%
  group_rows("MRI[note]", 5, 6, label_row_css = "background-color: #ddd; color: 999;") %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "20em", background = '#f5f5f5') %>%
  add_footnote(c(
     "`Neuropsych` counts all participants who completed both the follow-up RBANS and D-KEFS in full.",
     "`Blood` counts all participants who submitted one aliquot of plasma for bloodwork follow-up.",
     "`MRI` counts all participants who completed the T1 follow-up."), 
               notation = "number") %>%
  footnote(general = "Current month captures calendar month. The `%` columns describe percent retention - what proportion of participants who received their baseline scan have received their 6 month follow-up in time.")
```

###Demographics 

<br>

```{r demographics, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

demo_table <- make_demo_table(df, sites)

```

```{r demographics_table, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

demo_table$p <- as.numeric(demo_table$p)

#table
demo_table %>%
  mutate(
    metric = row.names(demo_table),
    p = cell_spec(p, "html", color = ifelse(p < 0.05, "red", "black"))
    ) %>%
  select(metric, CU, LA, UP, UT, WU, p) %>%
  kable('html', escape = F, align = c('l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c')) %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(1, width = "20em", background = '#f5f5f5') %>%
  footnote(general = "These values represent all participants consented at the OPTIMUM-Neuro baseline visit. It does not take into account the participants who consented but did not meet enrollment criteria, and/or who later terminated. Values in brackets are standard deviation. The _p_ values result from Chi-squared for categorical variables and omnibus ANOVA for continuous variables.")

rm(demo_df, demo_table)
